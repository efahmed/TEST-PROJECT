    An insider's guide to London, featuring the best hotels, restaurants, bars, shops, attractions and things to do, including how to travel there and around. By Sophie Campbell, Telegraph Travel's London expert. Click on the tabs below for the best places
    to stay, eat, drink and shop, including the best things to do and what to do on a short break.

  <h2> Why go? </h2>
</div>
  <p class="blocktext">
    Culturally, London is surfing the wave of recent events, including the Royal Wedding, Diamond Jubilee and London 2012 Olympics. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park has reopened and is anchoring another new quarter of London. Spaces such as the British Museum,
    the Royal National Theatre and both Tate galleries are expanding. The range of restaurants, bars, theatres, sports, pop-ups, performance art and large-scale events is astounding. Right here, right now, London is somewhere you have to be.
    <br>
  </p>
<div>
  <h2> When to go? </h2>
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
  London is always open for business, but expect skeleton service on big holidays and weather extremes (by our standards) may cause transport havoc. Shoppers pour in from across the world for January and July sales. The Frieze Art Fair has turned October
  into an unofficial art month. The quietest time is post- Christmas to late March and the busiest is July/August, when school groups arrive like noisy swallows to replace the holidaying business market. There is no summer exodus as in Paris or Buenos
  Aires.

<h3 id="flight">
  Flights</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  There are four airports, London Heathrow (due west), London Gatwick (south east), London Stansted (north east) and London Luton (north).
</p>
<h3 id="airport">Airport Links
</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  If not in a hurry, take the bus - they make several stops in central London, so may go near your hotel - or take the local stopping train with Souther (southernrailway.com). Victoria to Gatwick takes 36 to 58 minutes and costs £11 for a single, but be
  sure it stops at the airport.</p>
<h3 id="cruises">Cruises</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  Ships moor at Tilbury, 25 miles from central London in the Thames Estuary (londoncruiseterminal.com). There is a shuttle bus to Tilbury Town railway station, a mile away, where C2C trains reach Fenchurch Street in 35 minutes. Most passengers travel into
  London by coach, which takes approximately an hour.
</p>
<h3 id=train>Train</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  Eurostar runs out of St Pancras International, Paris 2hrs 15 from £69, Lille 1hr 20 from £69, Brussels 3hrs 4 minutes from £69.</p>
<h3 id="car"> Car</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  If you live in the UK, join ZipCar- joining fee £59.90 or £6 per month, and pick up a car for as little as £5 an hour or £49 per 24 hours. The Congestion Charge is paid automatically. EasyCar does good deals on small cars – from as little as £10 per day
  at Heathrow.</p>
<h3 id="bike">Bike</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  For longer periods, the London Cycling Campaign (lcc.org.uk) has a list of hire shops: On Your Bike (onyourbike.com) near London Bridge in Montague Close, SE1, does day hire for £18 for the first day and £10 thereafter and a week for £45.
</p>
<h3 id="taxis">Taxis</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
  London's renowned Black Cabs (tfl.gov.uk), famous for their long training, are the only ones allowed to ply for hire and are only available if their orange lights are on (tricky to see in summer). Minimum fare is £2.40 and fares jump after 8pm and again
  after 10pm. Download the Hailo app (hailocab.com/london) to find the Black Cab nearest to you for no extra charge

<h6> (Buses are cheaper, slower, have better views and mightily improved signage and maps.)</h6>
<p class="blocktext">
  The Tube, or Underground, is a fantastic network when running smoothly. The newest line is the orbital London Overground (coloured orange on the map), connecting 20 London boroughs. Buses are cheaper, slower, have better views and mightily improved signage
  and maps, but no longer accept cash.
